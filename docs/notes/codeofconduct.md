# Code of Conduct

In a Code of Conduct, you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the
collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up
together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain
agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and
adjust the agreements if necessary.


## Assignment description: 
In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group in this course.

* Working together to create a small app over the course of 9 weeks. The app will be a quiz-type
game for raising awareness about energy consumption. Also, developing our teamwork skills and
learning the basics of collaborating on code.

## Target or ambition level:
What grade are you working for?

* As a group our expectation is to get the highest grade possible, so we are aiming for a grade higher
than 8. We believe that with consistent work ethics, cooperation and hard work achieving this
grade is a realistic goal.

What is your goal at the end of the course?

* After this course, we want to have made new friends among our team, gain new practical skills and a sense of professionalism for our work. 

## Products:
What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS
Teams)? What standards must the submitted work meet?

* A completed, creative approach to the application, that serves the purpose of raising awareness
about energy consumption. Agendas and anything official is going to be shared through Gitlab,
while any of the drafts would be shared through Discord. We are planning on being as professional
with each other as possible. 

* Moreover, the product should meet the expectations of the client, but
also, we would like to challenge ourselves to add our own creativity and twists to the application.

* We want the agendas of our weekly meetings to be clear and specific and comply with the highest standards and formatting provided to us by the university institution. Our documents should be unanimously agreed upon by the team before the relevant meetings.

* Our HCI design report should be formatted according to the standards that were presented to us by the HCI lecturers.

## Planning:
How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in
the final deliverable and submits it to Brightspace on behalf of the project group?

* Having frequent meetings, and verbal check-ups is a great way. Moreover, we would also have
internal deadlines for each individual person. Also, we would like to add milestones in GitLab to
ensure we are on the right track. After the team takes a final approval, the chairman of the final
week submits the project on everyone’s behalf.

How are you going to split the tasks during the project?

* On the last meeting before every sprint, we want to assign the issues relevant for the upcoming sprint milestone.

When and how are you going to set up the internal deadlines?

* Our regular internal deadlines for each weekly sprint milestone are from Monday to Sunday. They are agreed upon beforehand and specified on our GitLab project repository.

## Behavior:
How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could
your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a
group meeting?

* We all treat each other with respect, we see each other in a professional way which enables us to
be critical to one another when it is necessary for the development of the product. We would start
with a compromise to reach an agreement, however, if the compromise takes longer than usual or
does not reach an agreement upon which we would put things to vote to reach an agreement
through democracy. We believe that we can handle each argument ourselves without the help of
the guide. If somebody is late, we would first wait for him for 5 minutes maximum, then we would
start the meeting without them, and give the person a warning. If this happens repeatedly, then we
would have to take the matter more seriously and possibly notify the TA.

* During the regular weekly meetings, we will ensure that the issues for the relevant milestone are divided equally among the team members based on what they have done during the previous weeks. That way, every team member will have worked on each aspect of the application at a certain point in the project development process.

What happens when you don't reach an agreement after voting?

* If there is no agreement between the team members after a voting session, we will allow the opposing sides to present their argument and if that does not convince anyone to switch their vote, the chairman of the relevant week has the final say on the matter.

## Communication:
In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (in the studio/MS
Teams/Miro/Discourse)

* We plan to have face-to-face meetings at least twice per week, one being the official Tuesday
meeting. In cases where we can’t all be present in a face-to-face meeting, then we would instead
have a Discord video call. We also use Discord and Whatsapp to notify each other about small
things such as Agendas, or ideas or to ask questions to each other.
 
## Commitment:
How do you determine the quality of each group's work, so that each group delivers the same quality?
How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

* For each person's issue, we would assign multiple reviewers according to the issue complexity who would check up on the work of the
person. In this way, everybody can get a second opinion on their work, and every member of the
group is engaged in the entirety of the application development.

* Reviewers will post their opinion about the developer's work in GitLab's comments section and discuss its problems so that mutual agreement is reached.

* We would also change the
reviewers of each person constantly, and at the start of each meeting, we would have a check-in
round to discuss the recent changes to make sure everybody is on the same page about the
progress of the last week. We would have a feedback round at the end of each meeting to
comment on the quality of the agenda, how the meeting was conducted and give feedback about
the last meeting’s notetaker’s notes.

## Meetings:
How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?

* We are planning on meeting twice a week, preferably on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

* In case the workload is too high, we will include more meetings in our schedule so that we can resolve all work-related issues.

What are the preparations for these meetings?

* Everybody should go through the agenda before the meeting on their
own. The chairman should publish the agenda two days prior to the meeting. Everybody should
have worked on their respective assignments prior to the meeting.  

How do you decide when to schedule other meetings?

* At the end of each meeting, we will decide whether more meetings are necessary for the weekly work to be completed. If that is so, we will compare our weekly schedules and decide on an appropriate time for everyone.

Are these meetings flexible? Can you cancel or reschedule them?

* Yes, meetings can be rescheduled in case an emergency pops up. This will be communicated through our Discord channel.


## Decision-making:
How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

* We would first try to reach a consensus through compromises, and if it takes longer than usual or
we were not able to reach a consensus then we would take a vote. If there is no majority, then the
chairman of that week has a final say. 

Should every team member comply with the decisions made as a group?

* Yes, every team member should comply with the decisions made as a group. The procedure for resolving conflicts is mentioned in the `Dealing with conflicts` section.

## Dealing with conflicts:
How do you handle conflicts within the group?

* Conflicts between a couple of members of the team would be resolved through somebody who is
out of the conflict (this can be a team member or a TA depending on the situation). 

## Guidance:
What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback
on, on the content or on the collaboration?
 
* We don’t plan on relying too much on the teachers and/or student assistants, but we do expect
that they will give us direction or guidance in case we have questions or if we are stuck at a certain
point during the project.

* We expect a clear description of what is expected of us during the project (mainly concerning our
final product).

* We would like to get weekly feedback from our TA mostly on our content, to see what we can
improve in our final product.

## Consequences:
What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?

* We should first talk to the person within the group, to discuss what they can do to keep the
agreements we made as a team and maybe what the group can do to stimulate that person to keep
the agreements. If this really doesn’t work, we as a group will go to the TA’s and address the
problem there, so that they can help us deal with the problem.

## Succesfactors:
What makes your team a dream team?

* From the first moment we met, we realized we have great chemistry, which was also confirmed by
our Belbin team roles (our roles complement one another). We have clear communication, a sense
of comradery. We all are eager to do our best for this project and we have similar ambitions.
