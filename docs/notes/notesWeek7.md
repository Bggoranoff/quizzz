## Agenda items

**Opening by chair**

**Check-in:** Stand up and inform each other on how thing are going.
    Everyone told the things they worked on this week:
    - Boris: Worked on the solo/multiplayer cycles and fixed some integration problems when merging.
    - Kevin: Made working quit and restart buttons for the solo game and added the players score to all scenes.
    - Bink: Added time as a factor to the point calculation and added the multiplayer results page with a rematch button that's almost working.
    - Patrik: Worked on the solo game, finalizing it.
    - Alican: Worked on the solo results page so that the top 30 players will be put on the leaderboard.
    - Calin: Worked on the solo ranking and results page making a leaderboard and putting the top three players on the podium.

**Demo:** Show a working solo game cycle from start to finish.

**Tips and Tops:** Give feedback to each other or to the whole team.
    - Boris: He is proud of everyone, because we have a working game. He did say that he could have reviewed more himself.
    - Patrik: He said it is great that we're done with must haves, and we did a good job as a team.
    - Alican: According to him, it is a good thing that we are more eager to learn from each other.
    - Kevin: He found it great that wee started earlier with working on the issues.
    - Bink: He also thought we did a great job as a team, but he wants to start earlier with his own issues and be more available on critical moments.
    - Calin: He's pleased with the progress, and he works better with the team now, but he still wants to start earlier with his issues.

**Question round:** Ask others or group TA any questions from the past week (final presentation, coding deadline, etc.).
    We need to do a bit of coding every week, so also week nine, which will be the last week. The deadline of the project will be the Friday of that week.
    The presentation about our project will consist of a formal video where we talk about the application and its features, but it doesn't need to be overly technical,
    and a Q&A session where we'll be asked technical questions about our project.

**Feedback round:** Ask group TA for feedback on the group progress.
    - Check the email for code contribution. We have to come up with a plan for those who don't contribute enough, in this case Calin.
    - Also check your mail, because some of you maybe need to redo the buddy check.
    - Reminder: We still have to do a manual UI check.
    - Some issues need better descriptions and a more elaborate task list.
    - Calin and Alican could commit more and get more issues.
    - Some methods are missing JavaDoc.
    - Some methods in the GameController are not tested.
    - Calin, Alican and Bink could review more.
    - Calin, Alican and Bink work more on server side.

**Summary action points:** Choose members responsible for the last meeting and clarify action points for next week.
    - Patrik is going to be the chairman and Kevin is going to be the note taker for next week's meeting.

**Task distribution:** Distribute the tasks for the last week of actual coding and choosing a live coding session time.
    - Boris and Patrik will add working emoji's using websockets.
    - Kevin is going to work on the 'double points' joker. 
    - Alican is going to work on the 'remove wrong answer' joker.
    - Calin and Bink are going to implement the 'decrease time' joker.
    - Calin and Alican are going to implement the features that inactive players (that don't answer for three consecutive questions) will be deleted from the game.
    - We will only work on the admin panel if we have time left.

**Closure**
